![Image of BBC USB slim version 1 board in green](https://github.com/Board-Folk/keys/blob/main/BBC%20B/images/bbcb_usb_slimv1_small.png)

This is a surface mount board designed to fit inside the BBC's case, though currently does not work with the original keyboard connected. Uses the Seeduino XIAO. The XIAO does take a few seconds to boot and recognise the keyboard, it's not as quick as the Atmega version.

* BOM

iBOM for the board.

* Gerber

Gerbers and gerber zip file for production.

* Kicad

Kicad project for the board.
