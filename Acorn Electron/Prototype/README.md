![Image of prototype v0 board in green](https://github.com/Board-Folk/keys/blob/main/Acorn%20Electron/images/electron_prototype_v0_small.png)

A PS/2 and potentially USB keyboard interface for the Acorn Electron based on C64keyboard by Robert VanHazinga using an Arduino type board and an MT8816 switch chip. This is the original throughhole board. 
It won't fit inside the case with the lid on, but is easy to build. The PS/2 configuration is for Arduino Nano, the USB, Seeeduino XIAO, same as the original project. USB code not done yet.
You may need to toggle Arduino IDE between processor ATmega328P and ATmega328P (old bootloader) depending on which Nano you have.
