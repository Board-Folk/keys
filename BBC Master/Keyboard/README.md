A Cherry MX switch compatible keyboard for the full size BBC Master (not Compact).

## Notes

* The board fits well, though does need some support top right. Screwholes were been added to attach a bracket of your fashion.
* Designed for a single 7U space bar with 3 switches instead of a stabliser, due to shortage of sensible ways of mounting that. Please fork and make suggestions.
* Stack nylon washers under the LEDs for stability

## Other

* Keys here from a set from AliExpress, some of which need relabelling
