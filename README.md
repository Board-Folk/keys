# Retro Keyboard and Keyboard Adapter Repository

This is repository for retro keyboards and adapters that have been used for projects over the past few years originally intended for private use helping with other projects.

As people have been asking it was thought it'd be worthwhile putting them somewhere in case they're of use to anyone else. Many have just been prototypes and not many have been finished, 
but I'll add them as I go. 'More Fun Making It' Lee showed the finished Acorn Electron PS/2 interface in one of his videos about Mogwaay's Electron ULA replacement work, so I'm starting there.

In complement to the Electron interface, the BBC B/B+ PS/2 and USB and BBC Master PS/2 adapters have been completed, they plug on the keyboard headers too, they need finishing up a bit. BBC B ones now uploaded.

There are many more to add after that too. May add replica keyboard / Cherry MX boards to here also.

Please feel free to make these yourself. Most project folders contain at least their gerbers and code. There's no guarantee anything works. Try help, improve and share if you can.
